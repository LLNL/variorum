Using Tools with Variorum
=========================

The JSON API enables Variorum to interface with higher-level system software.
Current integration efforts include a Kokkos connector for power monitoring and
a Flux power managment module.
Links to each of these frameworks can be found 
below. Note that these integrations with Variorum are in early development 
stages and are expected to be updated to support more features and tests.
Upcoming integration also includes developing a Variorum service for Caliper. 
  
    * Kokkos connector: https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos-tools/tree/develop/profiling/variorum-connector
    * Flux Power Manager Module: https://github.com/rountree/flux-power-mgr 

In order for tools to interact with Variorum, a simple Jansson based parser 
is sufficient. The format of the JSON object has been documented, and includes
total node power, as well as CPU, Memory, and GPU power (current assumption is
that of two sockets per node). It also includes the hostname and the timestamp.
We describe a simple example of how the data from 
the JSON object can be extracted from Variorum in the client tool below, 
and we point developers to the Kokkos and Flux integration links shown above 
for more detailed examples. We have used the JANSSON library for our purposes, 
but the JSON object can also be retrieved in a similar manner by other JSON
libraries and supporting tools.  

.. code-block:: c

    #include <jansson.h>
    
    void parse_variorum_data() 
    {
        // Define a JSON object to retrieve data from Variorum in
        json_t *power_obj  = json_object();
     
        // Define a local variable for the value of interest. For example, the
        // client side tool may only be interested in node power, or it may be 
        // collecting samples for integration. 
        double power_node;

        // Define a variable to capture appropriate return code from Variorum 
        int ret;
       
        // Call the Variorum JSON API 
        ret = variorum_get_node_power_json(power_obj);
        if (ret != 0)                                                                  
            printf("Variorum get node power API failed.\n");           

        // Extract the value of interest from the JSON object by using the 
        // appropriate get function. Documentation of these can be found in the
        // JANSSON library documentation. 
        power_node = json_real_value(json_object_get(power_obj, "power_node"));
        printf("Node power is: %lf\n", power_node); 

        // Decrement references to JSON object, required for JANSSON library.
        json_decref(power_obj);
    }
