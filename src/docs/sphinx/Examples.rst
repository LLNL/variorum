Example Programs
================

Variorum provides some examples in the `examples/` directory.

.. note::
    All example codes have a print and dump version showcasing the different
    printouts supported by Variorum.

Print Thermals
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The example below gets the thermal temperatures before and after running some
application. The ``print`` API prints the output in CSV format that can be easily
parsed by a data analysis framework, such as `R` or `Python`.

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/ex-print-thermals.c
    :language: c

Print Verbose Thermals
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The example below gets the thermal temperatures before and after running some
application. The ``print_verbose`` API prints the output in verbose format that
is more human-readable (with units, titles, etc.).

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/ex-print-verbose-thermals.c
    :language: c
