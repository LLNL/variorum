 Variorum API
##############

Variorum supports vendor-neutral power and energy management through its rich
API. Please refer to the top-level API, as well as the specific descriptions of
the JSON API and the Best Effort Power Capping API. The JSON API allows system
software interacting with Variorum to obtain data in a portable, vendor-neutral
manner.

***************
 Top-level API
***************

The top-level API for Variorum is in the ``variorum.h`` header file.
Function-level descriptions as well as the architectures that have
implementations in Variorum are described in the following sections:

-  :doc:`api/print_functions`
-  :doc:`api/cap_functions`
-  :doc:`api/json_support_functions`
-  :doc:`api/enable_disable_functions`

*******************
 Variorum Wrappers
*******************

As of v0.6.0, Variorum also supports Fortran and Python APIs for Variorum, these
can be found in the ``src/wrappers`` directory. By default, these wrappers will
be enabled. The Fortran wrapper is built and installed if Fortran is found and
enabled. For the Python module (called ``pyVariorum``), a ``pip`` based install
or setting of ``PYTHONPATH`` is needed. Please refer to the ``README`` in the
``src/wrappers/python`` directory for the details. Examples on the usage of
these wrappers can be found in the ``src/examples/fortran-examples`` and the
``src/examples/python-examples`` directories, respectively.

**********
 JSON API
**********

The current JSON API depends on the JANSSON-C library and has a vendor-neutral
format. The API has been tested on Intel, IBM and ARM architectures, and can be
used to easily integrate with Variorum (see :doc:`VariorumTools`).

Obtaining Power Consumption
===========================

The API to obtain node power has the following format. It takes a string
(``char**``) by reference as input, and populates this string with a JSON object
with CPU, memory, GPU (when available), and total node power. The total node
power is estimated as a summation of available domains if it is not directly
reported by the underlying architecture (such as Intel).

The ``variorum_get_node_power_json(char**)`` includes a string type JSON object
with the following keys:

-  hostname (string value)
-  timestamp (integer value)
-  power_node (real value)
-  power_cpu_watts_socket* (real value)
-  power_mem_watts_socket* (real value)
-  power_gpu_watts_socket* (real value)

The "*" here refers to Socket ID. While more than one socket is supported, our
test systems had only 2 sockets. Note that on the IBM Power9 platform, only the
first socket (Chip-0) has the PWRSYS sensor, which directly reports total node
power. Addtionally, both sockets here report CPU, Memory and GPU power.

On Intel microarchitectures, total node power is not reported by hardware. As a
result, total node power is estimated by adding CPU and DRAM power on both
sockets.

For GPU power, IBM Power9 reports a single value, which is the sum of power
consumed by all the GPUs on a particular socket. Our JSON object captures this
with a ``power_gpu_socket_*`` interface, and does not report individual GPU
power in the JSON object (this data is however available separately without
JSON).

On systems without GPUs, or systems without memory power information, the value
of the JSON fields is currently set to -1.0 to indicate that the GPU power or
memory power cannot be measured directly. This has been done to ensure that the
JSON object in itself stays vendor-neutral from a tools perspective. A future
extension through NVML integration will allow for this information to report
individual GPU power as well as total GPU power per socket with a
cross-architectural build, similar to Variorum's ``variorum_get_node_power()``
API.

Querying Power Domains
======================

The API for querying power domains allows users to query Variorum to obtain
information about domains that can be measured and controlled on a certain
architecture. It also includes information on the units of measurement and
control, as well as information on the minimum and maximum values for setting
the controls (control_range). If a certain domain is unsupported, it is marked
as such.

The query API, ``variorum_get_node_power_domain_info_json(char**)``, accepts a
string by reference and includes the following vendor-neutral keys:

-  hostname (string value)
-  timestamp (integer value)
-  measurement (comma-separated string value)
-  control (comma-separated string value)
-  unsupported (comma-separated string value)
-  measurement_units (comma-separated string value)
-  control_units (comma-separated string value)
-  control_range (comma-separated string value)

Obtaining Node Utilization
===========================

The API to obtain node utilization has the following format. It takes a string
(``char**``) by reference as input, and populates this string with a JSON object
with total CPU, system CPU, user CPU, total memory, and GPU (when available) utilizations.
It reports the utilization of each available GPU. GPU utilization is accompished using the
``int variorum_get_gpu_utilization_json(char **get_gpu_util_obj_str)`` function.
The total memory utilization is computed using `/proc/meminfo`, and CPU utilizations is
computed using `/proc/stat`.

The ``variorum_get_node_utilization_json(char **get_util_obj_str)`` function returns a string type
nested JSON object. An example is provided below.
{
    "hostname": {
        "CPU": {
            "total_util%": (Real),
            "user_util%": (Real),
            "system_util%": (Real)
        },
        "memory_util%": ,(Real)
        "timestamp": (Integer),
        "GPU": {
            "Socket_*": {
                "GPUn*#_util%": (Integer)
            }
        }
    }
}

The "*" here refers to Socket ID, and the "#" refers to GPU ID.

The ``variorum_get_node_utilization_json(char **get_util_obj_str)`` function returns a string type
nested JSON object. An example is provided below.
{
    "hostname": {
        "timestamp": (Integer),
        "GPU": {
            "Socket_*": {
                "GPUn*#_util%": (Integer)
            }
        }
    }
}

The "*" here refers to Socket ID, and the "#" refers to GPU ID.

***************************
 Best Effort Power Capping
***************************

We support setting best effort node power limits in a vendor-neutral manner.
This interface has been developed from the point of view of higher-level tools
that utilize Variorum on diverse architectures and need to make node-level
decisions. When the underlying hardware does not directly support a node-level
power cap, a best-effort power cap is determined in software to provide an
easier interface for higher-level tools (e.g. Flux, Kokkos, etc).

For example, while IBM Witherspoon inherently provides the ability to set a
node-level power cap in watts in hardware through its OPAL infrastructure, Intel
architectures currently do not support a direct node level power cap through
MSRs. Instead, on Intel architectures, fine-grained CPU and DRAM level power
caps can be dialed in using MSRs. Note that IBM Witherspoon does not provide
fine-grained capping for CPU and DRAM level, but allows for a power-shifting
ratio between the CPU and GPU components on a socket (see `IBM documentation
<https://variorum.readthedocs.io/en/latest/IBM.html>`_).

Our API, ``variorum_cap_best_effort_node_power_limit()``, allows us to set a
best effort power cap on Intel architectures by taking the input power cap
value, and uniformly distributing it across sockets as CPU power caps.
Currently, we do not set memory power caps, but we plan to develop better
techniques for best-effort software capping in the future.
