 Variorum Overview
###################

Variorum is a production-grade software infrastructure for
exposing low-level control and monitoring of a system's underlying hardware
features, with a focus on power, energy and thermal knobs. It is a significant evolution 
based on an older open-source library deverloped at LLNL, called ``libmsr``. 
Variorum is vendor-neutral, and can easily be ported to different hardware devices, 
as well as different generations within a particular device. More specifically, 
Variorum's flexible design supports a set of features that may exist on one generation of
hardware, but not on another.

******************
 Design Principles
******************

To guide the development of Variorum, we focused on a set of important
requirements extracted from our learnings with the development of ``libmsr``.
Here are Variorum's requirements:

-  **Create device-agnostic APIs**: We do not want to require the user to have
   to know or understand how to interface with each device. The library is
   built for a target architecture, which may be heterogeneous, and can collect
   data from each device through a single front-facing interface.

-  **Provide a simple interface**: We want users and tool developers to not
   only collect information from the underlying hardware, but also to have the
   ability to control various features.

-  **Ease in extending to new devices and generations within a device**:
   Variorum makes it easy to support new features, deprecate old features among
   generations of devices, and adapt features that may have different domains
   of control from one generation to another (i.e., sockets, cores, threads).
