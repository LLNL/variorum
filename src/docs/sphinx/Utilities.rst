Variorum Utilities
==================
Variorum provides some utilities to assist users and developers. Currently,
Variorum provides two main utilities:

* ``verify_opal.py``: A python script to verify the system environment (i.e.,
  OPAL) for IBM platforms.
* ``verify_msr_kernel.py``: A python script to verify the system environment
  (i.e., msr kernel or msr-safe kernel) for Intel.

Verify OPAL
-----------
This python script verifies that the OPAL files are present and have the
required R/W permissions on the target IBM hardware.

How do I use it?

From the top-level Variorum directory:

.. code:: bash

   brink2@lassen11:~]$ python ./src/utilities/verify_opal.py -v

   -- Check if powercap-max file is accessible by user: /sys/firmware/opal/powercap/system-powercap/powercap-max -- yes
   -- Check if powercap-min file is accessible by user: /sys/firmware/opal/powercap/system-powercap/powercap-min -- yes
   -- Check if cpu_to_gpu0 file is accessible by user: /sys/firmware/opal/psr/cpu_to_gpu_0 -- yes
   -- Check if cpu_to_gpu8 file is accessible by user: /sys/firmware/opal/psr/cpu_to_gpu_8 -- yes
   -- Valid OPAL access

Invoke the script with python on the target IBM system. The `-v` flag enables
verbose output, which can be helpful if your programs are running to
permissions issues. The output of this script is helpful to send to the mailing
list for debugging system issues.

The last line of the output will (verbose or not) will indicate if the IBM
OPAL files exist and have the appropriate permissions.

Why Do I Need This?
"""""""""""""""""""
This is a helpful utility to run before launching any examples or tests, as it
can verify that the required environment for Variorum is configured
successfully.

Verify MSR Kernel
-----------------
This utility will check if the stock msr kernel or the msr-safe kernel are
loaded and configured correctly with the appropriate R/W permissions. It will
first check if the msr kernel is loaded and has appropriate permissions. If
this fails, then it will check if the msr-safe kernel is loaded and has
appropriate permissions.
