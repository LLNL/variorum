 Quick Start Guide

The simplest way to install Variorum is using the default CMake settings. Building 
Variorum requires the ``hwloc`` and ``jansson`` libraries. The default build targets
the Intel platform and assumes `msr-safe` kernel module access. 

.. code:: bash

   sudo apt-get install libhwloc15 libhwloc-dev libjansson4 libjansson-dev

   git clone https://github.com/LLNL/variorum.git

   cd variorum
   mkdir build install
   cd build

   cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../install ../src
   make -j8
   make install

Note that ``HWLOC_DIR`` and ``JANSSON_DIR`` may need to be set correctly if 
installing from scratch. Variorum also supports ``host-config`` files, which make
the build process easier by setting all necessary paths in one place. Details on using 
host configuration files can be found `here <https://variorum.readthedocs.io/en/2022_update_docs/BuildingVariorum.html#host-config-files>`_. 

Please ensure that the dependencies for each platform are met before building 
Variorum. These include the kernel module ``msr-safe`` for Intel systems, ``msr``, 
``amd_energy_driver`` and HSMP driver for AMD sytems, OPAL firmware and sensors 
for IBM, and NVML for NVIDIA. Details of each of these can be found in the 
respective vendor pages, see :doc:`HWArchitectures`.

For more details about building and installing Variorum, see
:doc:`BuildingVariorum`, which provides detailed information about building
Variorum for specific hosts, Variorum's other CMake options and installing with ``spack``.

For beginners, the `ECP Variorum Lecture Series <https://www.exascaleproject.org/event/variorum-class-series/>`_ is beneficial.
