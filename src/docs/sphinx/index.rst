Variorum is an extensible, vendor-neutral library for exposing power and
performance capabilities of low-level hardware knobs across diverse
architectures in a user-friendly manner. It is part of the :doc:`Argo`, and is
a key component for node-level power management in the :doc:`PowerStack`.
Variorum provides vendor-neutral APIs such that the user can query or control
hardware knobs without needing to know the underlying vendor's implementation
(for example, model-specific registers or sensor interfaces). These APIs enable
application developers to gain a better understanding of power, energy, and
performance through various metrics. Additionally, the APIs may enable system
software to control hardware knobs to optimize for a particular goal. Variorum
focuses on ease of use and reduced integration burden in applications, which it
accomplishes by providing:

-  Examples which demonstrate how to use Variorum in a stand-alone
   program.
-  A performance analysis sampler that runs alongside the
   application.
-  A JSON API to allow integration with higher-level system software, such as
   job schedulers, distributed monitoring frameworks, or application-level
   runtime systems.
