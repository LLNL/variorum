An extensible vendor-neutral library for exposing performance montoring and
control capabilities of low-level hardware knobs.

Introduction
============

Variorum is an extensible library for exposing monitor and control capabilities
of low-level hardware knobs. Variorum provides vendor-neutral APIs such that
the user can query or control hardware knobs without needing to know the
underlying vendorâ€™s implementation. These APIs enable HPC application
developers to gain a better understanding of performance through various
metrics for the devices contained within the node. Additionally, the APIs may
enable system software to control hardware knobs to optimize for a particular
goal.

Variorum focuses on ease of use and reduced integration burden for code teams:

- It includes examples which demonstrate how to use Variorum in a stand-alone
  program.
- It includes an example performance analysis sampler that runs alongside the
  application.
