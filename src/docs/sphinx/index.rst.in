Variorum
========

A many-core capable lightweight in situ visualization and analysis infrastructure for multi-physics HPC simulations.

Introduction
============

Variorum is a system designed to explore the in situ visualization and analysis needs of simulation code teams running multi-physics calculations on many-core HPC architectures. It provides rendering pipelines that can leverage both many-core CPUs and GPUs to render images of simulation meshes.

Variorum focuses on ease of use and reduced integration burden for simulation code teams:

- It does not require any GUI or system graphics libraries.
- It includes integration examples which demonstrate how to use Variorum inside of three different HPC simulation proxy applications.
- It provides a built-in web server that supports streaming rendered images directly to a web browser.
