 PowerAPI
##########

The Power API is a community-lead specification for an power monitoring and
control API that supports small scale to extreme-scale systems. It is associated
with the Energy-Efficient High Performance Computing Working Group (EEHPCWG) and
also with the Exascale Computing Project (ECP). A community specification as
well as a reference implementation of the Power API can be found on their
website, https://pwrapi.github.io.

Upcoming goal for the Variorum team includes supporting relevant platform- and
node-level APIs from the Power API community specification.
