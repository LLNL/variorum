LIBVARIORUM EXAMPLES
====================
The examples directory contains some simple programs highlighting some of
Libvariorum's features and capabilities. We categorize the existing examples
into three categories:
1. Query functions: Query if feature is enabled or disabled.
2. Set functions: Provide control of a particular hardware-level feature 
3. Dump functions: Show current value of a particular hardware-level feature in
a column-delimited format
4. Print functions: Show current value of a particular hardware-level feature
in a verbose (long) format

QUERY FUNCTIONS
===============

ex-dump-hyperthreading
----------------------
Query if architecture has hyperthreading enabled. Return the number of threads
per core.

    $ ./ex-dump-hyperthreading

ex-dump-turbo
-------------
Query if architecture has TurboBoost (or equivalent) enabled.

    $ ./ex-dump-turbo

ex-print-topology
-----------------
Query topology of the node (e.g., number of sockets, number of cores per
socket, number of threads per core, etc.). Show a mapping of logical thread to
physical core.

    $ ./ex-print-topology

ex-print-features
-----------------
Query list of supported features for the current architecture. Show register
name and address.

    $ ./ex-print-features


SET FUNCTIONS
=============

ex-set-power-limits
-------------------
Set a power cap (across all sockets in a node) based on user-specified input
parameter. If no power cap is specified, then use a default power cap of 100W.

    $ ./ex-set-power-limits <pkg_power_limit>


DUMP FUNCTIONS
==============

ex-dump-clock-speed
-------------------
Show current clock frequency (reading IA32_PERF_STATUS on Intel platforms) and
average clock frequency (dividing IA32_APERF by IA32_MPERF on Intel platforms)
in column format. Search for tag `_CLOCKS_DATA` to filter out non-column
formatted information. The granularity of the reported clock frequency will
vary based on the architecture.

    $ ./ex-dump-clock-speed | grep _CLOCKS_DATA

ex-dump-counters
----------------
Show fixed counters, performance monitoring counters, and uncore counters in
column format.  Search for tag `_FIXED_COUNTERS`,
`_PERFORMANCE_MONITORING_COUNTERS`, and `_UNCORE_COUNTERS` to filter out
non-column formatted information for each particular set of counters.

    $ ./ex-dump-counters | grep _FIXED_COUNTERS
    $ ./ex-dump-counters | grep _PERFORMANCE_MONITORING_COUNTERS
    $ ./ex-dump-counters | grep _UNCORE_COUNTERS

ex-dump-power-limits
--------------------
Show the current power limits for the known domains (e.g., package, DRAM), as
well as the units fused into the hardware. Search for tag
`_PACKAGE_POWER_LIMITS`, `_DRAM_POWER_LIMIT`, `_PACKAGE_POWER_INFO`, and
`_RAPL_POWER_UNITS` to filter out non-column formatted information.

    $ ./ex-dump-power-limits | grep _PACKAGE_POWER_LIMITS
    $ ./ex-dump-power-limits | grep _DRAM_POWER_LIMITS
    $ ./ex-dump-power-limits | grep _PACKAGE_POWER_INFO
    $ ./ex-dump-power-limits | grep _RAPL_POWER_UNITS
    
ex-dump-power
-------------
Show current energy (raw) and power (derived over two samples) usage for the
known domains (e.g., package, DRAM). Search for tag `_PACKAGE_ENERGY_STATUS`
and `_DRAM_ENERGY_STATUS` to filter out non-column formatted information. The
first sample will show that 0 Watts were used, since the energy sample is taken
at time t_0.

    $ ./ex-dump-power | grep _PACKAGE_ENERGY_STATUS
    $ ./ex-dump-power | grep _DRAM_ENERGY_STATUS

ex-dump-thermals
----------------
Show current temperature information. Search for tag `_THERMALS` to filter out
non-column delimited information.

    $ ./ex-dump-thermals | grep _THERMALS


PRINT FUNCTIONS
===============

ex-print-clock-speed
--------------------
Show current clock frequency (reading IA32_PERF_STATUS on Intel platforms) and
average clock frequency (dividing IA32_APERF by IA32_MPERF on Intel platforms)
in a verbose format (not meant for parsing). The granularity of the reported
clock frequency will vary based on the architecture.

    $ ./ex-print-clock-speed

ex-print-counters
-----------------
Show fixed counters, performance monitoring counters, and uncore counters in
a verbose format (not meant for parsing). 

    $ ./ex-print-counters

ex-print-power-limits
---------------------
Show the current power limits for the known domains (e.g., package, DRAM), as
well as the units fused into the hardware.

    $ ./ex-print-power-limits

ex-print-power
--------------
Show current energy (raw) and power (derived over two samples) usage for the
known domains (e.g., package, DRAM). The first sample will show that 0 Watts
were used, since the energy sample is taken at time t_0.

    $ ./ex-print-power

ex-print-thermals
-----------------
Show current temperature information.

    $ ./ex-print-thermals
