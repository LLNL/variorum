$ make test

This runs all unit tests, which includes variorum APIs as well as system
environment checks, e.g., msr-safe validation, OPAL access. Most of these tests
will fail unless the environment has these access modules.

Travis: Need to install msr-safe. Cannot test OPAL access since the
architecture is Intel.

GitLab: Need to run on a compute node for Intel or IBM.
